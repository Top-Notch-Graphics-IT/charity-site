          Extenders Foundation is a Community Based Organization (CBO) whose
          mission is to improve the living conditions of orphans and the less
          privileged in the community. Our mission is to empower these groups of
          people through assistance, education and advocacy. Extenders
          Foundation has been in operation since 2014, helping the vulnerable in
          the community. Our committed team of volunteers and well-wishers put
          in a lot of effort to fulfill the groupâ€™s mission.
